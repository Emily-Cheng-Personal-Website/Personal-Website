# Personal-Website

Open main file: index.html. The about, portfolio, and javascript are linked. The javascript code creates an alert that pops up on only the home (index) page, though I was unfortunately not able to get it to only show up once - so it may pop up every time you open the home page. 

Updates on Part II: 
- Contact page added with fields & submit button linked to external HTML validation page
- Validation page added
- Major formatting changes including but not limited to: dynamic hover effects on links and images, improvements to layout (using flex/grid etc), switch to proportional units, and fixed background. 
- Added support for mobile & tablet view

Both the individual files and the compressed zip folder of all files are available in the repository.
